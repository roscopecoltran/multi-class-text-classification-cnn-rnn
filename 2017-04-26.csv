The phone is unlocked. The issue is that the phone is an unlocked GSM phone, while Verizon is a CDMA carrier. The buyer purchased the phone thinking it would work with Verizon, since the description said it was unlocked. No unlocked GSM phone will work with Verizon, unless it is also CDMA capable.

Thanks.

It even clearly has my ""thebestbeautyfinds"" watermark on their image which clearly shows it is mine.It is confusing to buyers as they see both listings with two of the same images and this is not right. I contacted the seller and nicely requested them to remove my image but they have not responded nor have they removed my image.I ask ebay to please remove their listing, they should not be allowed to use my picture which clearly has my ebay store TheBestBeautyFinds clearly written across the products.If you can get back to me and let me know if this can be done I would greatly appreciate it.

37434,,"Thank you for your attention to this case. I contacted the Louis Vuitton store to see if I could get a statement of authenticity and was told that isn't a service that any of their stores offer. 

While I wait for a returned phone call tomorrow regarding other options, I've attached pictures of the bag and the mailing box. The pictures point out the flaws in bag like, no interior tag with ""made in..."" on the side. The date tag coincides with the location on the bag. The labeling is printed on not stamped into the bag. The bag smells of a strong plastic scent. 

Once I received the bag, I used an article on eBay ""How to spot a fake Louis Vuitton bag date codes"" and it confirmed my suspicion. 

I will wait to hear back from an EBay specialist. 

Thank you!

The marina refused the ebike package from UPS and it was returned to sender or buyer! The buyer ignored the return address and RNA # that was given by the ebike manufacturing company...Allco Manufacturing and myself and chose to send it to an incorrect address without RMA #!

 Thank you very much for your help!
 To solve the problem,  I would like choose ""Find out the return shipping amount by using shipping calculators from the buyer's local carrier website (e.g. Royal Mail for UK), then issue the buyer with a payment through the ‚Äúsend money‚Ä?option in PayPal.""
  I have calculated by USPS shipping cost to CHINA , it is 6KG, as the picture, it is 95.45 USD total,
  Also, i have ""send money"" to the customer's paypal acocunt, i have attached the picture, pls check it,

  And i can't do "" leaving a note in the Resolution Centre.""

  So, is it everything ok now? what shall i do more next?

Thank you very much

Hello Ram,



We are contacting you about the open case for the Intel Xeon Engineering Sample 2.1GHz Processor (item 172322132868) that you purchased.  We just wanted to reach out to you to confirm you have been refunded. Because you did not pay with PayPal ebay is not able to see the status of your refund. The seller claims they issued your refund on 9/23/2016. Please confirm you received your refund by responding to this email or closing the open case on ebay.



We have placed the case on a 3 day hold until the end of Oct 8th for you to respond or close the case.  If we do not receive a response the case will be closed for the seller.  Thank you for being a valued ebay member, we hope all is well.



Thanks,

I would really appreciate if you remove the defect from our account. We are loosing business right now, because of the fraudulent eBay customer that put a scam on us and now we loosing business because of that defect. How it's fair, we have pictures from the manufacturer showing that the kit arrived damaged, the customer was also reported to eBay and ic3.gov, and now we can't sell more than 1000 items on eBay because of that? We already explained the situation before. The refund was not issued on time because the kit arrived damaged and we were waiting for a response from eBay, but instead eBay issued full refund automatically during labor day weekend when all businesses were closed.

2. Item (scooter) was damaged, and parts were missing. Seller (crtmoto-depot) was immediately notified approximately 3 weeks ago,

3. Seller (crtmoto-depot) indicated that they would get back to me with a resolution and tracking number for the replacement parts that were sent (about 3 weeks ago)
4. Spoke with Chris (crtmoto-depot) 2 weeks ago who indicated that he would have someone contact us by back right away. Someone called three days later but didn't leave any details or information in the message; they only left a message to call them back. We called them back 3 times, no one answered and calls were not returned.
5. I have yet to receive any tracking information on items that were supposedly sent out two weeks ago. It appears that nothing has been sent out; and it seems that no one is treating this as a priority.
6. The scooter has been sitting unusable in my garage for almost 3 weeks. This has been a horrible experience; and at this point, I just want my money back.
7. I have a requested a Full Refund in the amount of $  from the seller with details on how/when the item will be picked up.

It is now October 5th so it has been dragged for close to 3 months since
the original purchase and I still have not received the item yet.  Per your
suggestion I waited for re-delivery but nothing has been delivered yet.
Also you were not able to provide any tracking numbers.  At this point I
think I do deserve a full refund as this is a fail on eBay's part since
""Technically it is still in transit"" does not make sense anymore.

If I don't receive a refund within a few days I will be opening a dispute
with my bank.  Dispute will always go thru if delivery cannot be
confirmed.  Please advise, thanks.

37527,,"Hi,

The problem is an error with the global shipping program side.
White Sage (Salvia Apianna) is NOT on the restricted list for plants (""plants
are restricted for import by CITES (Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)"".
So your email response is is, to put it mildly, COMPLETE NONSENSE.

I ship white sage (Salvia Apianna), all over the world.   This includes
Singapore, (as well as Spain, Japan, Germany, Canada, Poland, England,
Thailand, etc. etc.).

Specifically, for Singapore, I have a [CERTIFICATION FROM THE USDA, United
States Department of Agriculture, Phytosanitary certificate, which states
that the sage has been inspected, ALSO Singapore customs reads my
certification for import into their country and accepted NUMEROUS packages
of sage (some as much as 20 pounds at one time).

This is my business, for the ebay global shipping program to arbitrarily
confiscate (and then ""resell"" the item to ""recoup there costs"") is
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.  My wholesale customer, in Singapore, is now
wondering what to do,  he has NOT BEEN REIMBURSED, NOR has he received his
(rightful property) sage!   That sage that was ""confiscated"" was extremely
valuable, high quality sage in Signapore is expensive!

Again,  I ship sage (salvia apianna) as a wholesaler, this is my business,
white sage is NOT RESTRICTED, IN ANY COUNTRY,",Specialty,Logistics - CCR

Ik heb in augustus een aankoopbedrag teruggekregen voor een product dat
niet aan de beschrijving voldeed, echter de verzendkosten heb ik toen niet
teruggestort gekregen. Mij is in onderstaande mail uitgelegd dat de
verzendkosten teruggestort zouden moeten worden door Pitney Bowes en dat
dit 2 tot 3 weken in beslag neemt meestal. We zijn nu 6 weken verder maar
ik heb het bedrag van de verzendkosten nog steeds niet terug mogen
ontvangen. Ik kan echter via Paypal geen geschil openen omdat het bedrag
van het product en de verzendkosten als 1 boeking wordt gezien, ondanks dat
het 2 bedragen zijn. Hierdoor krijg ik steeds de melding dat het bedrag
reeds is terugbetaald (bedrag van het product heb ik ontvangen) en dat ik
geen geschil kan openen. Erg vervelend. Ik zou alsnog graag mijn
verzendkosten terug ontvangen dus hoe ga ik dat oplossen? Bedankt vast voor
uw reactie.

Hello Rudolph,

¬†

 I have been contacted by your buyer of item (322239405426) stating they accepted the partial refund amount of 400.00.

I can see that you have issued them a refund of 100.00 already to cover the return shipping. Since this has been done you will

only be required to issue an additional 300.00 in order to have this case closed. Please make sure you complete this as soon as 

possible to avoid any further complications.

Important information regarding return 5038743295 SR# 1-88240530971


Hello Stephane,



I am reaching out to you in regards to the Apple Macbook (222254074964) you
recently sold. We see that your buyer has sent the item back to the return
address you have listed on your eBay which was undeliverable.



Due to the buyer sending the Laptop back to the address you have listed in
eBay, we ask that you refund them by the end of day 10/14/2016. I
understand the item is currently on its way back to the buyer, we ask that
you provide a valid return shipping label to him for which he has agreed to
send it back to you once a return shipping label has been received.



If you would like to send us a return shipping label, we will be more than
happy to forward that on to your buyer, as we have asked them to hold onto
the item for a minimum of 30 days to give you time to obtain a return
shipping label.



I know this can be a frustr",M2M Escalation,Buyer Protect High ASP Claim

Enter your response here:	Hello Tyler,From your message I believe I may not get a chance to explain my case before you make a final decision.Here is come clarification on the item that you may find helpful.I didn't sell this item as a working amp. The item is vintage, 60+ years old, and left my hands in the condition stated in the ad. I believe that the buyer mishandled the item which resulted in the damage.As the ad states:- the item is in original condition. - the item was untested in regards to function under power.- all transformers appear to test correctly with meter.I specified that the amp was intact with it's original parts, untested tubes, and capacitors dated 1947. Like any antique it's value is not in it's ability to perform it's original function. The buyer stated in an ebay message that he ran power through it using a variac and THEN found that the output transformer was bad.Most electronic technicians would consider turning on an amp of this age with a variac an irresponsible procedure, without testing other aspects first like measuring the old capacitors, and first testing the tubes that are in it or using other known good tubes.With an old amplifier such as this, using a variac alone is akin to putting gas in a 60 year old car that hasn‚Äôt been run in 30 years, starting it up without checking or changing the oil, and expecting it to take i",M2M Escalation,Buyer Protect High ASP Claim

All your details are correct - the question is what is printed from your 
system on the label.

Because the street is named K≈ôi≈æikova but you can get the result of K??i??
ikova on the label (because system does not know letters ≈æ and ≈ô)and that 
could be the reason wmy the local forwarder does not find it. But - as the 
next step - the label for sure have my telephone number as well right?

I have to say that noone contact me in this case that have the box for me 
and what he can do with that.




Could you please check the label and send the box once more onto the 
corrected address?

Many thanks

Jan

37605,,"no problem. I did want to talk with buyer but he does not seem to want to. What i am a little concerned about is that it is possible he is a fluke dealer and pulled part to fix theirs as he has one in picture that he compared to. He also has his feedback private so i cant be sure if he does buy and sell fluke test equipment.  In his picture it looked like a fluke piece of test equipment.
I also wanted to talk to him and see if he is a repair shop and if its repairable if it was really not working
Also its not easy to just click refund and ship back to ontario because if he put a value on it at all. I would have to pay tax on that at 13%. we could have got around that if he would have contacted me.

my ad did say no returns also so he should have had me do a few test on unit and send him some pictures so he knew worked well due to what it is.

We notice that some other autorised seller have been claiming intellectual
rights in some of our lisitngs. The right of selling in Europe is not
exlusive for them, there are more that one authorised seller and we buy all
our INOAR products throught one of them which is the main INOAR supplier
for France and also Europe. The people who have complaining about the
intelectual right they have the right to also sell INOAR product but no the
exclusivity as they argue. We are presenting all our documentation
attached, all from our authorised INOAR distribuitor WHICH IS ALSO WILLING
TO BE CONTACTED UPON ANY OTHER DOCUMENT OR INFORMATION YOU MAY NEED.
Eventually we belive this is a dirty move from our competitors in order to
kick us out of the business, however we can present you ANY INFORMATION
REQUIERE BY YOU in order to proves that we are authorised online retailers.
Feel fre to also contact me for anything you need but we really need to

Just for the record I dont  mind for a partial refund

IT is imposible to return the rear rotors pads and sensors because i used them also to see if discs fit  and pads you have to disarm the sensors and once you do that they are useless that's because is a porshce sports cart,

I want to make clear before i bought the kit i asked the seller and i gave all the information of my car and sent the vin number and he said it fit check the messages

also due to weight limits the shipping usps ebay label was useless so i paid more than 100 us dollars to sent back  the wrong items that the seller sent i sent the picture of the receipt.

I really hope you can help me with this guy is not serious and made me lost money and time i told him i dont mind the partial refund but i also need the shipping costs that i paid let me know if you need something else to help me with this case

I still haven't receive my money back. As Paypal can see that I won the case but eBay is confusing Paypal, by allowing Paypal to gave full refund to customer. I already contacted you once asking you to double check about the information you have provided to Paypal. But you confirm to me that information is correct. So I contacted the Financial Ombudsman Service, the UK‚Äôs official expert in sorting out problems with financial services to step in on my case. I have waited them to sort things out for a month, and the result is that this issue relates only to eBay relating selling the item to a customer. And eBay is only one who can tell Paypal where the money should go. 

Would you mind to pass the information to your manager and let me know whenever your manager is free? I know you are recheck my case so many times but I just want you to double check again for me. 

I hope you understand my feeling, loosing the money with no reason and no one helps. 

It is very difficult to deal with eBay.com as I am living in the UK. So can you make things easier for me please? Otherwise, I have to ask the financial company to step in to eBay side about the case.

As this email comes from ebay.co.uk, i'll try to reply it in English. My
apologies for any mistake i may do as it's not my first language.

The original delivery was rejected on arrival, as the package was highly
damaged.In Spain, the parcel company was SEUR and the T# SEU040008991180 .
They were supposed to return the package back to UK, to your International
Delivery Platform, as soon as possible. The tracking number you originally
provided was UPAAA000000181423052. So, the returning address must be
seller's address (186 Hamilton Rd, Felixstowe IP11 7DU, UK), not mine. You
can reach the store at +44 1394 671453.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me by mail or phone (+34 645161728)  in
the event that there's anything on my side i could do to ease the return
and refund process.

Thank you in advance for your help on this issue.

Dear Zhang,

 

Thank you for contacting eBay's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program.

 

We have reviewed your Notice of Claimed Infringement and the items you reported:

 

122038619277

112049956043

191949518203

182197945859

142069004186

282179895037

 

At this time the nature of your intellectual property claim is unclear, as you selected as reason code related to copyright infringement, but provided a patent registration number. The form you submitted was also incomplete, as it did not include your telephone number.

 

Please submit an updated NOCI form and correct this information. We can then assist you further. Thank you for contacting the VeRO Program.

Sincerely,

Alexis P.

Enter your response here:	Hi!

As I stated clearly, the piece will be in the bottom of my storage which means it is garbage, the rest I do not know what to tell you. Just that do not want to go through the headache to send back and etc. 
From a happy birthday present for myself turned to be something un pleasant and headache.

How fun can that be? I bought so many glass piece, this is the first time.

Hello Jason,



We are contacting you today about the Yamaha Receiver (eBay item: 131933089046) that you recently sold. I understand the buyer opened the case stating there are scratches all over the item and the panel won't fully close. We know these types of situations can be stressful. We are happy to help as we go through this case together.



We have reviewed all the information and we have found the buyer has a valid claim covered under the eBay Money Back Guarantee. With this in mind we have decided that the best outcome for this situation would be to have the item returned. With these returns the seller is responsible for the cost of return shipping. To allow time for you to arrange this return we have put this case on hold for 5 days (until end of day on 10/12/2016).

Hi,¬†
The seller just reached out to me and asked me to send it to the address she provided. Shw didn't provide me with the return label or offer to pay for the return but that's ok. I can cover the cost. Is it ok to send it back to her or am I supposed to wait for her to refund my money and then send the item back to her?¬†

I appreciate your email, but the shipment tracking information I received showed that the delivery took place in a town about 15 miles away from me. How do you explain that?

My address is clear. I order an identical item from the same seller 10 days prior. It arrived fine. 

What you are saying just does not make sense. The facts are that my item was delivered to someone in the wrong city. As the shipper, it is eBay's responsibility to deliver purchased items to the correct address. It is not my responsibility to follow up with customs or anyone else to find out what happened.

Sorry, but eBay is responsible to correct this error. Please let me know when you have it resolved.

Hi,
It's highly disappointing and unappreciated decision from ebay.The seller mailed me stating that if I do not pay the extra amount claimed the laptop will not be sent to me.The seller asked me to pay the extra amount through PayPal account. Finally, I made the extra payment.I asked the seller if he can claim item as low but it was in vain.I paid custom charges according to the amount I paid through PayPal that is $759.95 for the laptop at my end.
The custom office also was unable to switch on the laptop.
Only if I knew that the seller would claim me extra money outside ebay I would have chose another seller.
The laptop is defective.
I don't have money to buy another laptop.
I asked the seller to arrange the return for me.
Am I responsible the damaged packaging??
I am humbly requesting ebay to help me!
This seller fooled me.Please help me!

Subject:	My item was removed

Enter your question / concern:	Two products that I was selling was taken down due to copyright violation. Here are the listings that were removed:142120396681 - Kyani Triangle of Health Pack - Nitro FX + Sunrise + Sunset142120399559 - Kyani XTREME Triangle of Health Pack - Nitro Xtreme + Sunrise + SunsetI did take pictures from google search BUT I did knowledge on the button of the page where I got these images. However not all pictures were from that website.I was NOT notified to take down the images I would've fixed the problem before it went this far. And due too being a google image search I thought they didn't show copyright material.AND VERY IMPORTANT one of the items that you took down was a sold item. The person has paid for it and I have posted it. BUT I now can't contact the seller to inform her that her item has been posted and can't send her the registered postage number. I am very disappointed that I was not contacted beforehand, before it went this far. I would've fixed up my post. Tina

As per my lst email ‚Ä?you have placed a hold in paypal on these funds so I am UNABLE to issue the refund until you take it off!  You aren‚Äôt giving me the option of being able to refund the buyer whilst still holding the money!!!!!

 

This has been one of the worst dealing in Ebay.  The buyer and I agreed upon the refund yet ebay have managed to hold it up...  for over a week. 

 

It has been a total waste of my time and an extremely frustrating experience.  Please take the hold off the funds in paypal so I am able to issue the refund.

Their web page is Beckett.com if you need to learn more about them. PSA is the other industry leader for grading. I choose to use Becket as I have for many years. This is the first time I have had a altered status of a card. 

I sent the card in to be graded as the auction stated ""PSA ready"" and the card looked really nice. I guess if its too good to be true it probably is. Becket has placed the card in a protective holder that states ‚Äúaltered‚Ä?and I will have the card back on Monday and I will submit pictures of the altered status from Beckett. The fedex tracking number from Beckett to myself is 595420414806. In the meantime I have provided a screenshot of email and the the status of the card.

Thank you for your follow-up of this case. At this point, I am in
capability of demonstrating with several authentication documents from
different reputable third parties, including custom minifigure
manufacturers and reputable businesses within the Lego community, that the
Bizarro figure I received is indeed fake/counterfeit. It required
considerable time and effort for me to achieve this. At the same time, I
have good reason to believe (99% certain) that the remaining figures are
originals. I do not have the time (which, you would agree, is money), the
effort, and resources to obtain certification as to their originality.



I have dedicated considerable effort to following eBay‚Äôs procedure to
submitting the claim and obtain the protection and satisfaction that, as a
client, consumer, and long-time buyer of eBay I deserve. What I have
obtained so far instead has been considerable dissatisfaction and
frustration with a system that is not clear and that has provided me with
contradictory instructions, offers, and guarantees. While I, the client and
consumer have to get worn out with a process that does not seem to foresee
a partially counterfeit item, the seller remains silent and shields himself
behind a system that enables him to ignore the responsibility that he

Hi Nick,





Thank for responding back to us.



Just to kindly note also, with regards to the actual reshipment address. We are unable to ship an item to a different country. We can only ship to the original country in the order details which in this case would be Denmark. So as mentioned previously once we receive it back to the Shipping Facility, we will email you requesting a Danish Address and at that point you can choose to deliver it to your home address or your work address Nick.



Again, I do apologise for the inconvenience and delay in receiving your Figurine, I'm sure you're very anxious to add to your collection.





If you have any other concerns about the order then please do not hesitate in responding back to us.



Thank you again for your email, you have a great weekend.

Thank you for following up with us regarding the root grapple. 

Actually, we could see the grapple only had 1 shaft as it was delivered on a pallet so there was no opening involved. 
Once we saw it only had the singular shaft, we refused the delivery. 
The seller has been cooperative as they are making us a dual shaft root grapple as shown on the original 
advertisement and will deliver it. They explained it would take 4 week to manufacture & 1 week to ship so 
the new delivery should arrive around 10/21/16. 
I won't know for sure until the delivery whether all's good. 
If we can extend the open date for a few more weeks, that would be great. 
I am anticipating a happy resolution. 
Many Thanks, 
7515 Kelly

Hello. I received the label and dropped this item at the US Post office and the next day it was returned to me.
 
I got a 5 page letter saying that The USPS will ship motorized balance boards or hover boards only using Standard Post/Parcel Select.
 
It also says that the board must not have more than 2 batteries and each most not exceed 100 watts of power.
 
 
I am going to see a new label, preferably from FedEx or UPS, which allows this Boosted Board to be mailed.
 
Please get back to me, as this issue has been delayed again and I want to take care of this ASAP!
 
Have a great day! Smile More!

I am reaching out to you all to follow up with my current status on this
claim/case.

I have reached out to Overstock via the number on the attached email. My
case number for my phone call is 160913-004993. I was told by them that
they are going to schedule a pick up of the item, and they will give me a
couple days notice once it is scheduled although I haven't gotten any word
yet of a scheduled pick up.

Also I have the other email also attached that states that I have until Oct
11, to have the item marked for shipment. I just wanted to be fully
transparent and disclose and document this process. I am not at all
frustrated just keeping record and making sure that I am following the
proper guidance.

According to this email, I only have 7 days but... LOL.

Your eBay Money Back Guarantee case SR# 1-88351061521



Hello Yannick,



I'm contacting you about the return request your buyer has opened for the item Christian Louboutin Louis Straus Sneakers (252549471360) purchased by marinespeedster69 on 9/22/2016. As the item doesn't match the listing description, you'll need to pay for the return shipping, and once you get the item back refund the buyer the full cost of the item plus original shipping.



We've placed the return on hold for 5 days to allow you to arrange the return shipping with your buyer. If you don't provide a resolution to the buyer by 10/12/2016, we'll close the return in the buyer's favor and issue them a refund, even if they haven't returned the item.



There are a few ways you can facilitate the item's return:

If you have a preferred courier, you may wish to send your own return shipping label to the buyer.

Find out the return shipping amount by using shipping calculators from the buyer's local carrier website (e.g. USPS for US), then issue the buyer with a paym",M2M Escalation,Buyer Protect High ASP Claim

Enter your question / concern:	Hi! Just mailing to inform you that the courier you use in Sweden, BRING, is not delivering as they are paid for. Their tracking info says they have been trying to deliver at my address repeatedly but they most certainly have not been here (three adults home around the clock), and they have not even left a note in the mailbox. After extensive searching I have found emails from them in my spam folder. For me it is such a bad service it reflects poorly on you. Only informing via email is very insecure due to seller missing one single letter and package will get sent back. So far this has happened with: UPAAA000000184380209, UPAAA000000187548512, UPAAB000000172424952, UPAAA000000186734394 (I think those are the correct numbers, not the same as carrier uses). Just thought you should know and at least give them a hard time about it. Thanks, Maria

Our brand ‚ÄúAmbesonne‚Ä?is a registered trademark. When you search ‚Äúshower

however most of these are replicas or unauthorized copies of our shower
curtains.


We do have about 6 authorized sellers which sell our products but the ones

and our products aren‚Äôt made or located in China either.


These unauthorized sellers are using our designs, duplicating them and
selling counterfeits as the real thing. They are using our name, our work
and our images and selling these products which normally we should be
selling, especially on the first page. This this is affecting our sales
because most of the sales of our shower curtains and designs are going to
fake Ambesonne sellers.



This issue is not only about sales. These fakes sellers cannot print the
real designs and reach our quality levels with illegally copied designs and
images so this is also affecting our brand reputation and causing bad
feedback as these low quality products are reaching customers. Because of
poor customer satisfaction, our overall revenue which would normally be
reached by our Ambesonne sales has also decreased.

Regarding Case 5114665676 SR# 1-87191776043

 

Hello Mary ,

 

Thank you for your previous email regarding case 5114665676. I am sorry this case has not gone as you had hoped. It appears this case was closed in the seller's favor because we did not have valid tracking to show that the item was shipped out within the allotted timeframe. I have placed this case on a 3 day hold, until 10/3/16, in order to allow you time to provide this information. If we can confirm that the item was shipped out by 8/30/16 we can continue with the refund process. We appreciate your patience and cooperation with this process. 

 

Sincerely,

Jim L.

exlusive for them, there are more that one authorised seller and we buy all
our INOAR products throught one of them which is the main INOAR supplier
for France and also Europe. The people who have complaining about the
intelectual right they have the right to also sell INOAR product but no the
exclusivity as they argue. We are presenting all our documentation
attached, all from our authorised INOAR distribuitor WHICH IS ALSO WILLING
TO BE CONTACTED UPON ANY OTHER DOCUMENT OR INFORMATION YOU MAY NEED.
Eventually we belive this is a dirty move from our competitors in order to

Important Case (5114858003) Update: Your Action Required SR# 1-88184281833



Hello David,



We are following up with you today in regards to the Samsung 65"" 4K Ultra HD Smart TV (eBay item: 172321046701) that you recently purchased.  I'm sorry to hear that you've opened a claim because there is a bubble in the screen and appears to be damaged.  We understand the frustration you've experienced during this transaction and apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. We want to work with you to ensure that this issue is resolved in a timely manner.



We also appreciate your patience while we respond to your email. We have had a recent influx of emails, and since each one is answered personally it has taken us some time to reply to everyone.



In order to have this case resolved, we ask that you provide us with photos of the item that support your claim.  Please make sure that you include photos of any damage/inconsistencies with the item along with photos of any identifying marks or serial numbers",M2M Escalation,Buyer Protect High ASP Claim
37888,Copyright infringement items on Ebay,"To whom it may concern

One of our Copyright poster designs has appeared on Ebay again. One seller has 8 separate listings(!), and there are another 2 sellers with forgeries of our design.

I have completed the relevant paperwork and attach the certificate of registration of design, as well as signed Copyright agreement with our house artist.

Please could you take these listings down at the earliest opportunity?

I look forward to your confirmation.

37891,Policy General,"Hi ebay and thanks for contacting me regarding my missing item.
I have been updated on a regular basis about the location of the item. The
latest info was that the item had arrived in Oslo on 31.august and that is
was awaiting pickup. That is the last update on the item. I have not
received any pick up notice or been contacted by any of the norwegian
delivery services og post offices.
About a week ago I contacted the norwegian national post office with the
international tracking number I was given by ebay. I also contacted all the
major delivery services in Norway to see if they had any track of the item.
Non of them can find any info on the item or the tracking number, They all
tell me the same, that there is no info on the package ever arriving in
Norway.

My adress and phone number is 100 % correct. I have used that adress for
alle other ebay orders, and other mail services, for the last eight years.
There has never  been any problems with delivery before this incident.
Please try to resend it to Stensgata 33 A, 0358 Oslo, Norway. There is also
a possibility of sending the package to my working adress: Kenneth
Erlandsen, Arba inkludering As, Ringeriksveien 193, 1339 V√∏yenenga.

I really hope this sorts out and that the package arrives.

Thank you for the assistance.

Yours sincerely

Subject:	Returning an item

Enter your question / concern:	I have asked eBay to step in on a return and have not yet received a response from you. This is regarding the Latek Philippe watch I purchased for $999 + $30 shipping. I notified you after the purchase but prior to receiving the item since the item was listed as authentic and from Pittsburgh, PA but, in fact, it came from Hong Kong, China. I have taken the watch and box to an authorized dealer and both are fakes. The Seller has offered to credit me $600, which just goes to show it is, indeed, a fake/unauthentic item. I need eBay's help with getting a full refund for this item in the amount of $1,029.00.  Thank you. Regards - Eggward/Graham Michener

Thank you for reaching out. The customer has opened a return case which we
gladly accepted and provided prepaid return labels right away. I have
issued 4 shipping labels to the customer via email but I was only able to
upload 1 to the return case as it would not let me upload any more.

The customer has all 4 prepaid labels and can ship the item back. I am not
sure why the customer has not shipped the item back yet as per the return
case since the return labels were in her possession since 9/26/2016. I am
also not sure what intentions the customer has as they proceeded to open a
case even though we have been nothing but helpful in accepting her return
and issuing labels.

I have also attached a copy of those labels here for you to forward to the
customer if they are claiming they have not received it. Please assist,
thank you!

37914,"Re: Regarding the Joie mirus Scenic Stroller, item # 121945549416 SR# 1-84634921245","Dear Christopher, 

Thank you for the explanations but I still want to precise several points as it is the first time I use EBay and surprised that there is no way to get my purchase in case I made mistake in the delivery address. Or being reimbursed for the purchase. 
So you're saying that my item was most probably liquidated and that there is no way to be reimbursed? Did I get you right?

I've checked what other people are saying about similar cases as apparently I am not the only one to make mistakes in address for whatever reason.
Here are some cases indicated in the eBay community and no one says about liquidation of purchases that had false address. 
Let me know if there are any options in my case to be reimbursed. 

Thank you in advance,

It should also be noted that this buyer gave me the financial run around for a week stating EBAY had frozen her account.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this tea set and I have not committed any kind of buyer fraud!  I am completely offended and again once I receive this tea set back I will refund her.

here is the copy that was sent today:

I am sorry you were not satisfied with the Sterling Silver Tea Set and I will refund you the money when the tea set and tray and all items have been shipped back to me and none of it has been damaged. All the items were listed and photographed with my jeweler on September 15th. I can send you money through my pay pal and will send you 15$ - the cost to ship to you was 10$ -
