# Memex tools and components

A list of memex-related tools and their repository URLs

## Crawlers

#### ACHE Crawler

[https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/](https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/)

ACHE is a focused web crawler. It collects web pages that satisfy some specific criteria, e.g., pages that belong to a given domain or that contain a user-specified pattern. ACHE differs from generic crawlers in that it: employs learning classifiers to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant pages in a given domain, and automatically learns how to prioritize links in order to efficiently locate relevant content while avoiding the retrieval of irrelevant content.

#### Scrapy Cluster
[https://github.com/istresearch/scrapy-cluster](https://github.com/istresearch/scrapy-cluster) (stable).
This project uses Redis and Kafka to create a distributed on demand scraping cluster.
Additional documentation: [http://scrapy-cluster.readthedocs.io/](http://scrapy-cluster.readthedocs.io/)



#### Undercrawler
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/undercrawler](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/undercrawler) (stable) This is a generic Scrapy crawler designed to handle a number of challenges that are hard for traditional generic crawlers, such as dynamic content, login and search forms, pagination. It crawls from the given seed url in breadth first order, exporting all crawled pages and documents into the Memex CDRv2 format.

#### Deep-Deep
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/deep-deep](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/deep-deep) (dev) Deep-Deep is a Scrapy-based crawler which uses Reinforcement Learning methods to learn which links to follow. It is called Deep-Deep, but it doesn't use Deep Learning, and it is not only for Deep web. Weird.

#### Scrapy-Dockerhub
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/scrapy-dockerhub](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/scrapy-dockerhub) (alpha) Scrapy-Dockerhub is a deployment setup for Scrapy spiders that packages the spider and all dependencies into a Docker container, which is then managed by a Fabric command line utility. With this setup, users can run spiders seamlessly on any server, without the need for Scrapyd, which typically handles the spider management. With Scrapy-Dockerhub, users issue one command to deploy spider with all dependencies to the server and second command to run it. There are also commands for viewing jobs, logs, etc.

### Crawler Utilities


#### Aquarium

#### AutoLogin
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/autologin](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/autologin) (stable) AutoLogin is a utility that allows a web crawler to start from any given page of a website (for example the home page) and attempt to find the login page, where the spider can then log in with a set of valid, user-provided credentials to conduct a deep crawl of a site to which the user already has legitimate access. AutoLogin can be used as a library or as a service. 

#### AutoLogin-middleware
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/autologin-middleware](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/autologin-middleware) (stable) Scrapy middleware for the AutoLogin utility.

#### LinkRot
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/linkrot](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/linkrot) (dev) A script (Scrapy spider) to check a list of URLs periodically to determine whether a page is still alive or whether it has been 404â€™d. 

#### MaybeDont
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/MaybeDont](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/MaybeDont) (stable) MaybeDont is a library that helps avoid downloading pages with duplicate content during crawling. It learns which URL components are important and which are not important during crawling, and tries to predict if the page will be duplicate based on its URL. The idea is that if you have a crawler that just follows all links, it might download a lot of duplicate pages: for example, for a forum there might be pages like /view.php?topicId=10 and /view.php?topicId=10&start=0 - the only difference is added start=0, and the content of this pages is likely duplicate. If we knew that adding start=0 does not change content, then we would avoid downloading the page /view.php?topicId=10&start=0 if we have already fetched /view.php?topicId=10, and thus save time and bandwidth.

#### Scrash-LUA-Examples

#### Scrapy-Crawl-Once
[https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/scrapy-crawl-once](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/scrapy-crawl-once) (stable) This package provides a Scrapy middleware which allows to avoid re-crawling pages which were already downloaded in previous crawls.

#### SRI HSProbe
[https://github.com/pporras7/TeamSRI-LIGHTS] (https://github.com/pporras7/TeamSRI-LIGHTS) (stable).
HSProbe is a python multi-threaded STEM-based application designed to interrogate the status of Tor hidden services (HSs) and extracting hidden service content. It is an HS-protocol savvy crawler, that uses protocol error codes to decide what to do when a hidden service is not reached. HSProbe tests whether specified Tor hidden services (.onion addresses) are listening on one of a range of pre-specified ports, and optionally, whether they are speaking over other specified protocols. As of this version, support for HTTP and HTTPS is implemented. Hsprobe takes as input a list of hidden services to be probed and generates as output a similar list of the results of each hidden service probed. (Python)

DDT is an interactive system that helps users explore and better understand a domain (or topic) as it is represented on the Web. DDT allows a domain expert to visualize and analyze pages returned by a search engine or a crawler and provide feedback about their relevance. Based on this feedback, the system guides the user in the creation of a model for the domain of interest. This model can then be used by a focused crawler such as ACHE to automatically discover and download a large number of web pages that belong to the domain.
