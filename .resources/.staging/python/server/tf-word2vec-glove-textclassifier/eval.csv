1-118797880380,,"Hi Katherine,Over dinner, I mentioned to my wife about the problem with the numerous fakes on Ebay and her advice was not to get involved.  I asked her why and she said ""there could be consequences"".  She might be right so I will not put in writing the name of the fellow who is selling all the counterfeits.  However, the user name that I briefly mentioned on the phone is the seller who is doing this.  When I looked on the computer I only saw a small sample of the coins listed but when I checked again this was the same fellow as he was selling twenty plus fake ancients coins.  Hopefully, someone wrote down his user name when I mentioned it.I did a Google search and found two things that may be helpful to you.  Check out the following:1.  Forvm's notorious fake sellers list (NFSL).  This is an ancient coin dealer who has an extensive list of Ebay sellers who sell fakes.2.  Spotting fake silver Roman coins, with actual pictures.  The author says ""as many as 30-40% of ancient coins sold on Ebay, at the moment, are modern fakes"".

To give you a littlebackground, I have been repairing ATV engines for over 34 years andcurrently do the engine machine work for several hi volume ATV/UTV repairfacilities and dealerships.  The Honda TRX450 engine that we sold MrHathcock was thoroughly checked out and test riden on 3 differentoccasions.  Mr Hathcock contacted us by phone and said the engine still ranperfect but had started to smoke after half a tank of fuel.  I informed himthat I was concerned because the photo he had sent us showed that the atvhad extremely large aggressive tires that were made exclusively for intensemud riding and that the photo showed fresh mud on the atv.  From workingwith new Honda dealerships over the years I know that this is enough tovoid the factory warranty on a brand new atv.  During our discussion MrHathcock and I both agreed that the reason for the motor to smoke is due toa cylinder and piston issue.  Mr Hathcock said he was very capable ofremoving the cylinder and piston and i told him that if he would get thoseparts back to me I could inspect and measure them and could tell exactlywhat caused them to wear and make an engine to begin to smoke.  I felt likehe was going to do that and I told him i also wanted to do an oil analysesto make sure that the oil had not been contaminated by mud and wat",M2M Escalation,Buyer Protect High ASP Claim

Those include but are not limited to: Coin Operated Table Football, Coin Operated Pool Table etc. We have several future products in the pipeline such as Air Hockey Table and others.2) Our family business ""Eleftheriou"" was founded by my grandfather George Eleftheriou in 1950 and is the only manufacturer of classical table football in Northern Greece.
